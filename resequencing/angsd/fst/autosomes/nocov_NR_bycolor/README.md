#### By phenotype

Trying to run these analyses by merging together populations that have the same phenotype. E.g. all with white shoulder, or all with white chest, to do Fst comparisons.

However, getting an error on realSFS each time that is completely mysterious. Generated from running angsd 0.920. Testing 0.918 now. Opps - this was just SFS for within populations (whats the purpose of this?). Meant to run 2dsfs

Had issues with running without setting nsites. So halfed the nsites that I had. No error when running without nsites, just failed.
