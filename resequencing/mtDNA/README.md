Quick notes June 15, 2018

MITObim is the only one producing anywhere near coherent results

Alignment in Geneious was not producing good results

I tried MAFFT following this tutorial:
https://github.com/mmatschiner/tutorials/blob/master/multiple_sequence_alignment/README.md

I copied this to my macbook and ran BGME as suggested

I then used Aliview to delete large chunks that some samples were clearly misaligned or had many samples with large gaps

Then I ran RAxML on the phylip output

The file that includes '_og_' is the one with an outgroup. 'nogap' refers to when I decided to cut out sections where there were gaps for several samples.

The last tree I ran today wsfw_og_filtered_heavy_edit_nogaps.phy
